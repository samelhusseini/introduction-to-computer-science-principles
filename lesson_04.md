## Instructor's Notes

1. Introduce Activity
   * Tell students that today they will explore PXT and use it to create a "self-portrait" program.
     * Emphasize that the goal of today's lesson is _**not**_ for students to develop a deep understanding of any of the features in PXT.  Later lessons will teach them everything they need to know.  For now, they should just explore, figure out what they can, and put it to use however they see fit.
   * Spend just a couple minutes demonstrating how to open PXT, create sprites and scripts, and run programs.
     * **DO NOT** go into detail-- the specifics of PXT will be covered in much more depth in unit 1.  The goal here is simply to give students enough of a starting point to be able to explore and try things out on their own.
   * Show students the [lab handout](lab_04.md) and read through the instructions.
     * Point out the places to write answers to the written questions in parts 1.2 and 1.3.
     * Draw special attention to the list of requirements for the self-portrait program in part 1.4.
     * This is an excellent opportunity to tell students that all labs in this course will look similar to this, and that they should get used to reading instructions carefully.
2. Activity
   * Instruct students to complete the ["Getting to Know You"](lab_04.md) lab.
     * For part 1.3, you can either assign pairs or allow students to pair up on their own.  If students are allowed to choose their own partners, take care to ensure that no one is excluded.
     * If the class has an odd number, form a single group of three.
3. Debrief
   * Ask each student to identify and describe _one_ feature they discovered in PXT.  Keep a running list on the whiteboard or projector.
     * If the students build a pretty comprehensive list, you can use this as a chance to go over a brief roadmap for the course.
   * Ask students what they enjoyed about working with PXT and what they disliked.

## BJC Lecture Suggestions

#### Good for Classroom Instruction

* BJC Video Suggestion: [BJC Lecture 4: Functions ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uKCBmQEf5w&t=18m15s)
  * [Types of Blocks](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uKCBmQEf5w&t=18m15s)  18:15-19:45

## Accommodation/Differentiation

* Allow students to use whatever resources they need, including instructors, peers, and web searches if necessary, to create their programs.  The goal of this lesson is exploration and exposure, not mastery.
* For students that are hesitant or unwilling to engage, point out some simple, useful features \(like basic drawing and the ![](say.png) block\) to get them started.  Remind them that complexity or "coolness" are not important for this lab.
* If you wish, you can add a second day to this lesson for students to share out their programs.  Work with your classroom teacher and/or school IT staff to determine the best way for students to be able to present.
  * One simple option is to have all students share their projects with you, and then show each one in turn on the teacher computer/projector.
* Have a plan for collecting or accumulating the students' programs, which you can then use to get to know your class!
